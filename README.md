# 🧠 IndustryForecast: Machine Learning–Based Industrial Workforce Prediction

This project analyzes changes in regional industrial structures using real-world employment data from 2017 to 2022.  
By combining statistical analysis and machine learning, it predicts the direction of industrial growth and decline for 2023.  

Chi-square tests were used to verify that industrial compositions differ significantly between population-increasing and population-decreasing regions.  
Subsequently, Random Forest and K-Nearest Neighbor classifiers were trained to model these regional trends, and a soft-voting ensemble achieved the highest accuracy.  

Results show that:
- **Population-decreasing regions** are dominated by **construction (26%)**, **health & social welfare (16%)**, and **manufacturing (12%)**.  
- **Population-increasing regions** are led by **manufacturing (18%)**, **professional & technical services (13%)**, and **retail trade (13%)**.  
- The model achieved an accuracy of **83%**, with strong generalization in predicting industrial growth patterns.  

These findings provide an interpretable foundation for **regional policy planning** and **industrial strategy design** based on workforce transitions.

## 📂 Project Structure
```
├── main.py # Training and validation logic for RNN & LSTM models
├── generate.py # Generates text using the trained model
├── model.py # Defines Vanilla RNN & LSTM architectures
├── dataset.py # Loads and preprocesses the Shakespeare dataset
└── shakespeare_train.txt # Source text data for training
```
## 🚀 How to Run
### Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/daewook1004/DeepLearning_LangugeModel.git
cd DeepLearning_LangugeModel
```
### Install dependencies
```bash
pip install torch numpy tqdm
```
### Train the models
Run the training script to train both RNN and LSTM models:
```bash
python main.py
```
The script will automatically train both models, log training/validation losses,
and save the best models as best_rnn_model.pth and best_lstm_model.pth.

### Generate Shakespeare-style text
Once training is complete, generate new text using the trained LSTM model:
```bash
python generate.py
```
You can modify the seed character and temperature in generate.py
to control creativity and text variation.

### View results
Generated samples and loss plots are saved in:
```bash
graph_pictures/
best_lstm_model.pth
best_rnn_model.pth
```

# 💬 Discussion
- **Low Temperature (0.3–0.5):** High grammatical accuracy, low creativity.  
- **High Temperature (1.0–1.5):** High creativity, frequent grammatical errors.  
- **Optimal Range (0.7–1.0):** Most natural and expressive Shakespearean-style text generation.

> The LSTM model with temperature values between **0.7–1.0** best reproduces the poetic and rhythmic qualities of Shakespeare’s writing.
